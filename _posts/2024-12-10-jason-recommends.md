Hello, friends!

It's that time of year againâ€”the season of twinkling lights, cozy evenings, and, of course, Christmas music filling the airwaves. As someone who has spent countless hours diving into the sounds of the world, I can't help but feel a particular warmth for Christmas. There's something magical about this season that makes music resonate deeper, doesn't it?

One of my favorite discoveries in recent years has been [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden). If you haven't tried it yet, Radio Garden is like having the whole planet's radio stations at your fingertips. What's truly wonderful during the holidays is exploring how different cultures celebrate Christmas through music. From classic carols in New York to tropical interpretations in the Caribbean, every station has its unique charm. I encourage you to spend an evening just scrolling and letting the festive sounds take you somewhere new.

Christmas music holds a special place in my heart. Growing up, we always had Bing Crosby's *White Christmas* spinning on the record player, and no holiday season was complete without Nat King Cole's *The Christmas Song*. Later, as I started building my own collection, I fell in love with Vince Guaraldi's *A Charlie Brown Christmas*â€”its jazzy, melancholic warmth still gets me every time.

And then, of course, there's *Last Christmas* by Wham!, a song that's been more than just a holiday tune for me. Back in my late 20s, during a challenging breakup, it became the soundtrack to a bittersweet December. It's amazing how music can be both a balm for the soul and a time machine. Hearing it now reminds me of growth, resilience, and the beauty of moving forward while holding onto the joy of the season.

These days, Christmas is all about making new memories with my family, sharing my own quirky takes on classic carols, and introducing my kids to the magic of the season. And Radio Garden has become a family traditionâ€”each year, we explore different countries' holiday stations together, marveling at how music brings us closer to people we'll never meet but still feel connected to.

So, grab a cup of cocoa, curl up on the couch, and give Radio Garden a spin. Let the world's Christmas stations fill your home with joy and wonder. Who knows? You might stumble upon your own new favorite holiday tune.

Wishing you all a season filled with love, music, and memories!

Cheers, Jason ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ¶
