## Transistor: Where Sound Comes First

**“In the beginning was the sound.”** If Jason Playback and Orson Rewind had written the opening lines of Genesis, these words would have defined their philosophy. Transistor, their collaborative project, is more than a musical endeavor—it’s a sonic exploration where the center is the sound itself.

Born out of countless late-night sessions in Jason’s garage, Transistor is a meeting of two creative minds with complementary strengths. Jason’s meticulous approach to programming and his obsession with detail mesh seamlessly with Orson’s instinctive improvisation and fascination with textures. Together, they weave a tapestry of sound that is both futuristic and nostalgic, fusing cutting-edge technology with vintage charm.

Transistor is a project rooted in process. Its essence is research: field recordings from the desert, urban soundscapes, and forgotten radio broadcasts. These are deconstructed, manipulated, and reimagined through sound synthesis. It is experiment: pushing boundaries, blending analog warmth with digital precision. It is discussion: endless debates over textures, tones, and the emotional weight of every note.

Yet, for all its technological depth, Transistor is also deeply human. The project honors the past, embracing the crackle of old vinyl, the hum of shortwave radios, and the imperfect beauty of vintage instruments. Jason and Orson see Transistor as a bridge between eras, a conversation between yesterday’s nostalgia and tomorrow’s possibilities.


## Transistor Collective Manifesto

**1. Radio as Source, Sound as Canvas**\
We are Transistor, an artistic collective that draws from the endless frequencies of radio waves—voices, static, songs, and signals—transforming their raw transmissions into new sonic landscapes. Every broadcast is a source of creation, every sound a potential composition. We pull from the ether, remixing the world as it unfolds.

**2. The Future is Noise**\
Inspired by the Futurists, we embrace noise as the foundation of our music. The hum of machines, the hiss of static, the fragmented rhythms of cities and airwaves—these are our instruments. In the chaos of sound, we find beauty and truth. Technology is not our tool, but our collaborator. We push it to its limits, exploring glitches, errors, and imperfections to generate something unexpected.

**3. Genre is Irrelevant**\
Music should have no boundaries. We defy the genre labels, crossing electronic, experimental, ambient, and industrial lines, merging them into a new language. We create with a keep it simple, make it fast attitude—immediacy and instinct drive our process. We reject the artificial divisions between music and noise, between sound and song.

**4. Technology as Art**\
In a world saturated with sound, we exploit technology to make the invisible audible. From analog radio waves to digital distortion, from vintage transmitters to cutting-edge software, we experiment with the past and the present to shape the future. We don't just use machines; we converse with them, allowing technology to shape the narrative as much as we shape the sound.

**5. Sound Everywhere, Always**\
There are no limits to where music comes from or where it can be found. All sound is music—whether it's a lost frequency or a discarded pop song, a voice breaking through static or the steady hum of a forgotten channel. We believe in the democratization of sound, drawing from all sources and all environments to construct our compositions.

**6. Chaos is Creation**\
Order is a construct. The sounds we use are fragmented, interrupted, nonlinear. Like the Futurists, we embrace speed, disruption, and change. Our compositions are not predefined—they emerge from the act of discovery, from the unexpected collisions of sound, frequency, and form.

**7. Always Forward**\
We are the architects of new sonic futures. We strive for music that is not just heard but felt. We want to challenge, provoke, and rewire the way people experience sound. In every performance, every track, every experiment, we ask: What comes next?
We are Transistor—where technology, noise, and human instinct collide.
