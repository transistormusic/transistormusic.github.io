## 1991 - 2001

From the ages of 20 to 30, **Jason Playback’s** life was a whirlwind of study, discovery, relationships, and career beginnings. At 20, he enrolled at *Desert Valley University* to pursue a degree in *Digital Systems and Programming Logic*, an emerging field at the time. Desert Valley was a few hours from Redrock, allowing Jason to enjoy a bit of independence while still visiting home on weekends.  

University life brought new challenges and friendships, and Jason was thrilled to dive deeper into the world of programming. The workload was intense, but he thrived on the challenge, tackling programming languages and systems architecture with the same dedication he'd once given to math and music. During his second year, he met **Sarah Lawson**, an art major with a passion for photography. They bonded over late-night study sessions and shared many discussions about creativity and technology. Sarah’s artistic perspective encouraged Jason to see coding as an art form, and she inspired him to think outside the box in his projects. Though their relationship lasted just a year, Sarah’s influence lingered, and Jason never forgot her unique view on blending art and technology.  

In his final year, Jason met **Emily Tran**, a fellow programming student. Emily was sharp, ambitious, and loved electronic music as much as he did. They attended concerts, experimented with synthesizers, and even co-wrote a few tracks. Emily introduced him to **synthesizer programming**, sparking a lasting passion for electronic music production. Their relationship didn’t survive the transition to post-graduate life, but their creative energy fueled his fascination with music and computers.  

At 27, after completing his degree, Jason returned to Redrock and began working at **ByteWave Solutions**, a small yet innovative tech company serving local businesses. ByteWave was where he met **Orson Rewind**, a fellow developer with a unique, experimental flair. Orson, an eccentric and talented musician, shared Jason's love for electronic music and introduced him to **analog synthesis**. Together, they formed *Transistor*, an electronic music project that would become Jason’s creative outlet outside of work. The duo spent nights in Orson’s garage studio, merging coding skills with musical experimentation, and developing a distinctive sound rooted in their combined technical expertise and love of retro electronic music.  

By 30, Jason had found his footing in the tech industry and music world alike, thriving as a developer at ByteWave Solutions while pursuing his creative dreams with *Transistor*. These years marked the true beginning of his journey as both a programmer and musician, blending his passion for technology with the influences and friendships that shaped him.

## 2001 - 2011

In his 30s, **Jason Playback** faced some of his most challenging years. Shortly after turning 32, he experienced the unexpected loss of his father, **Richard**, to a heart attack. Just a few years later, his mother, **Linda**, passed away after a brief battle with illness. Losing both parents within such a short span left Jason reeling. The once-stable foundation of his family life felt shattered, and the loss cast a shadow over his normally optimistic outlook.  

Compounding his emotional struggles were physical health issues. Jason began to experience chronic spine problems, with severe back pain that occasionally left him bedridden. He also suffered from **diverticulitis**, leading to bouts of pain and a few extended hospital stays. During one of these stays, Jason met **Dr. Hannah Reyes**, a compassionate and sharp-minded gastroenterologist who managed his treatment. Hannah’s warmth, humor, and insight into his health made an immediate impact, and they formed a close bond that grew from friendship into a deeply supportive relationship. After his recovery, they continued to see each other, and eventually, they married.  

As he neared 40, Jason's life took a hopeful turn when he and Hannah welcomed twin daughters, **Lily** and **Emma**. Becoming a father was a transformative experience, bringing new joy and purpose to Jason’s life. Through these difficult years, Jason found new resilience, supported by his family and fortified by the legacy of his parents' strength.

## 2011 - Present

From 40 onwards, **Jason Playback** found new vitality both in his career and his creative pursuits. He continued working at **ByteWave Solutions**, where he developed a series of innovative software solutions, some of which combined his love of technology and music. Programs like *EchoSynth* (a synthesizer emulator), *TrackWave* (a music production app), and *TempoCraft* (a rhythm generator) gained local acclaim, helping both aspiring musicians and tech enthusiasts experiment with sound.  

His collaboration with **Orson Rewind** also deepened. *Transistor* began to perform at private parties, local clubs, and charity concerts with titles as quirky as their music, like *Beats & Waves*, *The Redrock Reverb Fest*, and *Echoes for Hope*. These shows allowed Jason and Orson to share their unique sound, which blended ambient electronic textures with live digital effects, and became a beloved part of Redrock’s arts scene.  

In 2020, Jason and Orson embarked on an ambitious project to create a full-length album for *Transistor*, titled *Shortwave*. Inspired by vintage radio transmissions and mysterious frequencies, the album captured the ethereal, haunting quality of sound fragments drifting across airwaves. They gathered clips of radio noise, obscure broadcasts, and static, weaving these sounds into a richly layered ambient experience that was as much a sonic exploration as a musical record.  

In reality, though, **Jason Playback** is a fictional character, the brainchild of Portuguese musician **Jorge Prendas**. Crafted as a reflection of a tech-savvy musician shaped by his time and influences, Jason’s life offers a tribute to the passions, struggles, and creativity that define so many artists and innovators across the globe.
