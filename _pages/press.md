## **"In the Beginning Was the Sound"**

Transistor, the innovative electronic music collective led by Jason Playback and Orson Rewind, proudly presents their debut album, *Shortwave*. This groundbreaking project is a sonic journey that blurs the boundaries between past and future, technology and nostalgia, weaving a rich tapestry of sound recorded from the global airwaves.

Rooted in their classical music training, Jason and Orson approach *Shortwave* with the precision of composers and the curiosity of sound archaeologists. Utilizing advanced audio processing techniques, they transform raw radio transmissions into intricate musical landscapes. The album was carefully mixed and mastered for both coherence and diversity, ensuring an immersive listening experience that captures the nuanced textures of their collection of radio sounds from all around the world.

## The Concept

The genesis of *Shortwave* emerged during the solitude of the COVID-19 lockdowns. With time on their hands and the world in a state of flux, Jason and Orson found inspiration in the invisible web of radio waves that connect people across the globe. Over months of meticulous work, they recorded hundreds of hours of radio broadcasts from every corner of the world, capturing fragments of music, voices, static, and silence. These raw materials became the threads of a patchwork that combines the immediacy of modern technology with the warmth and imperfection of vintage sounds.

## The Album

Comprising 11 tracks, *Shortwave* is a global auditory adventure. Each piece transports listeners to a unique locale, blending the evocative sounds of radio transmissions with Transistor's signature experimental flair. Highlights include *Madagascar*, *Ulaanbaatar*, *Babel*, or *Budapest Rádió*.

The album isn't just music—it's a meditation on how sound connects us across distances, cultures, and time.

## The Process

Creating *Shortwave* was both a technological feat and an artistic challenge. Together, Jason and Orson listen to hundreds of hours of their recordings and acted as sonic tailors, stitching together disparate elements into cohesive and evocative tracks. They acted as craftsmen who transform a collection of sounds into new music. 

## The Vision

*Shortwave* is a love letter to the magic of radio. It celebrates the medium's ability to carry stories, emotions, and memories across borders, uniting people through sound. For Transistor, this record is just the beginning—a bold statement of their commitment to pushing the boundaries of what electronic music can be.
